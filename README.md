# Languini

## What is Languini?
**Languini** is a competition in which Caaz, Zanacross and Drwdal go head to head developing the same project in whichever language they choose. The hope to do this weekly, if all goes well.

## Why?
Because everyone could use a little development motivation. This entire project came to be by a conversation in *#TheFusion@Rizon* If you want to be a part of it, feel free to join us.

## Rules
- Coding begins on Saturday, 00:00.
- Coding ends on Monday, 00:00.
- Specific rules of each challenge can not be changed once they begin.

## Judging Criteria
- Readability of Code, meaning that one can easily look at the source and follow what is actually happening at a given point.
- Organization of Code, meaning that your functions, variables, and other thingamabobs are in an actual meaningful order.
- Features of Project, meaning the actual features of the project made. While all projects have a specific goal, extra points should be awarded to those who can go above and beyond them.

## Challenges

### 01 - Virtual Pet

Because we have no friends of our own, the first challenge will be to create one of our own! Like the story of Frankenstein we will have to build some kind of life simulation with the power of technology!

###### Rules
- Must have a GUI of some sort
